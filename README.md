# About this repository

Demo application #1 uses Redis core data structures, Streams, RediSearch and TimeSeries to build a
Java/Spring Boot/Spring Data Redis Reactive application that shows a searchable transaction overview with realtime updates
as well as in investments overview with realtime stock updates. UI in Bootstrap/CSS/Vue.

Demo application #2 does not use Redis, instead it uses an RDBMS. It's a text based (Lanterna) based application
that simulates an aging trading desk application. The application itself will communicate exclusively with the database.
Via RedisCDC these changes will appear in demo application #1.
